# News Classification App

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles into four categories: **World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech**. The solution leverages text data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and ensemble learning techniques to achieve high accuracy. A user-friendly Streamlit-based web app allows interactive predictions based on user input.

## Features

- Preprocessing and vectorization of raw news text using TF-IDF.
- Ensemble learning with stacking of Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and LinearSVC models.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Streamlit frontend for easy, real-time prediction with category mapping and prediction confidence.
- Lightweight and efficient, suitable for deployment.

---

## Dataset

- Dataset used: AG News Dataset (from Kaggle), which contains news articles categorized into World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.
- Training data size: 120,000 samples (30,000 per category).
- Testing data size: 7,600 samples.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nayann23/NEWS-CATEGORY-CLASSIFICATION-USING-ENSEMBLE-LEARNING.git
   cd news-classification-app
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Ensure `stacking_model.pkl` and `tfidf.pkl` are in the project directory (these files contain the trained model and vectorizer).

2. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open the displayed local URL in your browser.

4. Input news text and click **Predict** to see the predicted news category.
